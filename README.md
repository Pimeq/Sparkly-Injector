# Sparkly Injector!

Some things to know
---
Sparkly Injector uses a DLL that the `Custom GUI` project compiles.
The program will *not* work if the DLL is next to it.


You need to download an assembly merger to make the DLL part of the injector.

Example: https://ilmergegui.codeplex.com/


I will not help you with a paste of the injector or how to make it undetected. It's really easy to do. If you want a less detected 

version, visit https://www.Discord.io/SparklyCheat (my Discord) for the download and news on the cheat this injector comes with.
